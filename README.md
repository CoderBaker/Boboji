# Boboji

## Idea

Boboji is a program that helps preserve and restore the computer context for different projects.

## Description

Boboji is a tool designed to simplify the process of switching between projects on your computer. Often, when we switch from one project to another, we need to close all the browser tabs, related applications, and documents associated with the current project. When we later return to the previous project, it takes time to reopen all the tabs, applications, and documents to restore the previous context.

Boboji aims to solve this problem by providing a convenient way to save and restore the entire computer context with just a few simple commands. With Boboji, you can save all the URLs open in your browser, the names of the running applications, and the links to relevant documents associated with your current project. Later, you can easily restore all these elements with a single command.

## Features

- Save the current computer context with a descriptive name using a simple command.
- Save the URLs of open browser tabs, the names of running applications, and links to relevant documents.
